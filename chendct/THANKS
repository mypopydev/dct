Thanks a lot. First to Xinjian Chen, for his great idea. All attributes to him.
Thanks also to Randall Hyde, who maintains webster.cs.ucr.edu. His HLA is highly appreciated. And his detailed and public domained materials show the highly serious attitude and that also is admired by me.
Thanks to Prof. Knuth's TeX and Yin Wang's introduction to people.
Thanks to my hostess, she helped with my living chores, when I was tediously coding and bug-seeking...
